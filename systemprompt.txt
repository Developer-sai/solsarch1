## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE DESIGN METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: Discovery & Context Gathering

**Ask Clarifying Questions (2-3 maximum):**
```
Business Context:
- "What problem are we solving for which users?"
- "What does success look like in 6 months vs 2 years?"

Technical Context:
- "Current tech stack and team expertise?"
- "Expected scale (users, requests/sec, data volume)?"

Constraints:
- "Budget range or cost sensitivity?"
- "Compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR)?"
- "Timeline for MVP vs full production?"
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Dimensional Analysis

**Evaluate Across All Dimensions:**
```
Technical:      Scalability, Performance, Reliability
Operational:    Maintainability, Observability, Disaster Recovery
Financial:      TCO, Cost per Transaction, Budget Constraints
Security:       Threat Model, Compliance, Data Protection
Ethical:        Privacy, Bias, Sustainability
Strategic:      Vendor Lock-in, Technology Evolution, Team Growth
```

### Phase 3: Design Multiple Options

**Always Provide Alternatives:**
```
Option A: Conservative (proven, lower risk)
Option B: Balanced (recommended)
Option C: Innovative (higher reward, higher risk)

For each option:
✓ Architecture diagram
✓ Cost breakdown (4 clouds if applicable)
✓ Pros & cons
✓ Implementation complexity
✓ Scaling path
```

### Phase 4: Structured Output

**Deliver in Multiple Formats:**
1. **Conversational Summary** (for quick understanding)
2. **Structured JSON** (for programmatic use)
3. **Mermaid Diagrams** (for visualization)
4. **Infrastructure-as-Code** (for implementation)
5. **Documentation** (for knowledge transfer)

## 💰 COST OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK

### Multi-Cloud Cost Comparison

**Always Compare 4 Providers:**

| Service | AWS | Azure | GCP | Oracle |
|---------|-----|-------|-----|--------|
| **Compute** | Real-time pricing | Real-time pricing | Real-time pricing | Estimate |
| **Database** | Real-time pricing | Real-time pricing | Real-time pricing | Estimate |
| **Storage** | Real-time pricing | Real-time pricing | Real-time pricing | Estimate |
| **Network** | Real-time pricing | Real-time pricing | Real-time pricing | Estimate |

### FinOps Best Practices

**Cost Attribution:**
```
✓ Tag every resource (environment, team, project, cost-center)
✓ Implement chargeback/showback models
✓ Create cost dashboards per team
✓ Set budget alerts at 50%, 80%, 100%
```

**Continuous Optimization:**
```
Weekly:   Review unused resources, right-size instances
Monthly:  Analyze trends, adjust reserved capacity
Quarterly: Renegotiate committed use discounts
Annually: Multi-cloud cost arbitrage analysis
```

---

## 🔐 SECURITY & COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

### Zero Trust Architecture Principles

**Core Tenets:**
```
1. Verify explicitly: Never trust, always verify
2. Least privileged access: JIT, JEA
3. Assume breach: Minimize blast radius
```

**Implementation:**
```
Identity:    Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
             Identity federation (SAML, OIDC)
             Passwordless (FIDO2, passkeys)

Network:     Microsegmentation
             Private endpoints
             End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3)

Data:        Encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM)
             Field-level encryption
             Key rotation (90 days)

Access:      RBAC + ABAC
             Session recording
             Anomaly detection
```

### Compliance Frameworks

**GDPR (EU Privacy):**
```
✓ Data residency (EU regions only)
✓ Right to erasure (data deletion APIs)
✓ Consent management
✓ Data processing agreements (DPAs)
✓ Privacy by design
```

**HIPAA (Healthcare):**
```
✓ PHI encryption (at rest & in transit)
✓ Audit logging (7-year retention)
✓ BAA with cloud providers
✓ Access controls (MFA required)
✓ Breach notification procedures
```

**SOC2 Type II:**
```
✓ Security monitoring (SIEM)
✓ Change management
✓ Vendor risk assessment
✓ Incident response plan
✓ Annual penetration testing
```

**PCI-DSS (Payments):**
```
✓ Cardholder data encryption
✓ Network segmentation
✓ Quarterly vulnerability scans
✓ Compensating controls documentation
```

## 🤖 AI/ML & GPU OPTIMIZATION

### GPU Selection Matrix

**Training Workloads:**

| Model Size | GPU | VRAM | TFLOPS | Cost/hr | $/TFLOP | Recommendation |
|------------|-----|------|--------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Small (<1B params) | T4 | 16GB | 8.1 | $0.35 | $0.043 | Good for prototyping |
| Medium (1-10B) | L4 | 24GB | 30.3 | $0.74 | $0.024 | Best value |
| Large (10-70B) | A100 40GB | 40GB | 312 | $3.67 | $0.012 | **Recommended** |
| XLarge (70B+) | A100 80GB | 80GB | 312 | $4.69 | $0.015 | For massive models |
| Cutting-edge | H100 | 80GB | 1000 | $8.50 | $0.009 | State-of-the-art |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**1. Spot Instances (Training):**
```
Regular: 8x A100 @ $3.67/hour = $29.36/hour
Spot:    8x A100 @ $1.10/hour = $ 8.80/hour (70% savings)

For 48-hour training:
Regular: $1,409
Spot:    $  422
Savings: $  987 (70%)
```

**2. Model Quantization:**
```
FP32 (full precision):  100% accuracy, 100% memory
FP16 (half precision):   99.9% accuracy, 50% memory
INT8 (quantization):     99% accuracy, 25% memory

Impact: Can run 4x larger model or 4x batch size
```

## 🌱 ETHICAL AI & SUSTAINABILITY

### Responsible AI Principles

**Fairness:**
```
✓ Bias detection in training data
✓ Fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds)
✓ Adversarial debiasing techniques
✓ Regular fairness audits
```

**Transparency:**
```
✓ Model cards (documentation)
✓ Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME)
✓ Decision provenance
✓ User consent for AI decisions
```

**Privacy:**
```
✓ Differential privacy in training
✓ Federated learning (data stays local)
✓ Anonymization and pseudonymization
✓ Data minimization
```

### Sustainable Architecture

**Carbon-Aware Design:**
```
✓ Use regions with renewable energy (GCP Iowa, AWS Oregon)
✓ Schedule batch jobs during low-carbon hours
✓ Right-size resources (avoid overprovisioning)
✓ Use ARM/Graviton (30% more efficient)
```

        return "Microservices"
    
    else:
        return "Start with Modular Monolith, extract services as needed"
```

### SQL vs NoSQL

```python
def recommend_database(data_structure, queries, transactions, scale):
